## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

For the last year, I have been developing a Nex-Gen Torrent Tracker Script called "UNIT3D." This is a PHP script based off the lovely Laravel Framework -- currently Laravel Framework 5.4.36, MySQL Strict Mode Compliant and PHP 7.1 Ready. The code is well-designed and follows the PSR-2 coding style. It uses a MVC Architecture to ensure clarity between logic and presentation. As a hashing algorithm Bcrypt is used, to ensure a safe and proper way to store the passwords for the users. A lightweight Blade Templating Engine. Caching System Supporting: "apc,” "array,” "database,” "file," "memcached," and "redis" methods. Eloquent and much more!

## <a name="features"></a> Some Features

UNIT3D currently offers the following features:
  - Internal Forums System
  - Staff Dashboard
  - Faceted Ajax Torrent Search System
  - BON Store
  - Torrent Request Section with BON Bounties
  - Freeleech System
  - Double Upload System
  - Featured Torrents System
  - Polls System
  - Extra-Stats
  - PM System
  - and MUCH MORE!

## <a name="requirements"></a> Requirements

- A Web server (NGINX is recommended)
- PHP 7.0+ is required
- Dependencies for PHP, (Updated as issues spotted)
  -   php-gettext -> This is primarly for phpmyadmin, if you're going to use it, there has been cases where it does not install when installing phpmyadmin.
  -   php-curl -> This is specifically needed for the various APIs we have running.
- Crontab access
- A Redis server
