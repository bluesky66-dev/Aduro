## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

For the last year, I have been developing a Nex-Gen Torrent Tracker Script called "UNIT3D." This is a PHP script based off the lovely Laravel Framework -- currently Laravel Framework 5.4.36, MySQL Strict Mode Compliant and PHP 7.1 Ready. The code is clean and to PSR-2 coding style standards. Using MVC Architecture to ensure clarity between logic and presentation. Bcrypt hashing algorithm for generating encrypted representation of a password. A lightweight Blade Templating Engine. Caching System Supporting: "apc,” "array,” "database,” "file," "memcached," and "redis" methods. Eloquent and much more!

UNIT3D currently has the following features:
  - Internal Forums System
